functionality
=============
* notify user to order meal at noon using IM or email

* put items.html and vendors.html into one page which has an xbox style navigated layout
* integrate with GoogleMap to find vendors around the user
* add a member in group page should reassemble igoogle's todo list, i.e. adding just in place.

restructure
===========
* use a customized jquery ui with minimum set of functionality (so far tab only)
* replace the User in group with google user, we will have User as the Account, and google user will be the connection key in these tables
* try to remove all trace of google db from view and control

Misc
====
* use ajax libraries hosted by ajax.googleapis.com, like douban does
